== Pipelines

All of the necessary pipelines are defined in the `taskctl.yaml` file. These can be called as many time as necessary so can be used to build and deployment to different environments.

NOTE: The examples show in this section are specific to the `github.com/amido/stacks-dotnet` project, but the overall pattern will be the same for all Stacks(?) projects.

Within the configuration for Taskctl there are tasks and pipelines. Each of the tasks runs any number of commands in the specified context. A pipeline can be defined using any number of tasks. By default all tasks in a pipeline are run in parallel, but this behaviour can be changed by setting dependencies.

There are three pipelines configured.
