== Notes

There are some issues with the `taskctl` as an independent runner. They are not insurmountable but they cause some niggling issues when run.

=== Global variables cannot be set

The README for the Taskctl projects suggests that it is possible to define global variables within the configuration file. However when this is done an error is generated by the Golang templating engine saying that the variable cannot be found.

=== Variables set on a task do not work in a pipeline

Variables can be set on a task as well as when that task is called in a pipeline. It appears that even variables set on a task are not available so have to be duplicated on the call to the task in the pipeline.
